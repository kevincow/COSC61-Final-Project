# COSC61-Final-Project

## Kevin Cao

Welcome to my final project repository for Dartmouth's COSC61 course (23X term)! This project involves creating a normalized sql database using data about any particular topic found online, using this database to generate queries that answer interesting questions regarding the chosen topic, and extending/enhancing the database by incorporating it for a broader purpose (e.g. a webgame). I'm a lifelong baseball fan, so I chose to create a baseball database using Retrosheet's data on player stats and biographies, team stats and biographies, and game logs. I created a webgame that is based on the increasingly popular sports trivia game the [Immaculate Grid](immaculategrid.com).

This project is split into four milestones, each building on the other in order to create the final product. 

## Milestone 1 - Initial Dataset and Questions
* Find a suitable database online
* Think about interesting questions that could be answered with the data
* Content can be found on the Project Wiki and in the [Data subdirectory](https://github.com/kevincow/COSC61-Final-Project/tree/main/Data)

## Milestone 2 - Database Build Plan
* Using the data, construct an entity-relationship diagram for the potential database that will be constructed
* Create a plan and pseudocode towards constructing the database
* Content can be found on the Project Wiki and in the [Milestone-2 subdirectory](https://github.com/kevincow/COSC61-Final-Project/tree/main/Milestone-2)

## Milestone 3 - Database Implementation
* Write and execute a script that implements the schema of the database from Milestone 2
* Import the data into the database
* Execute a SQL query to answer a question from Milestone 1
* Content can be found on the Project Wiki and in the [Milestone-3 subdirectory](https://github.com/kevincow/COSC61-Final-Project/tree/main/Milestone-3)

## Milestone 4 - Database Enhancements
* Integrate additional features to extend the working database (creation of a webgame)
* Answers to questions from Milestone 1
* Content can be found on the Project Wiki and in the [Milestone-4 subdirectory](https://github.com/kevincow/COSC61-Final-Project/tree/main/Milestone-4)
* Video of gameplay can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SUqj6fXK3nTCg7GRLq4a85wilPRJ7OyH/view?usp=sharing)
